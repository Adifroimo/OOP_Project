Welcome to the "Vehicles-Factory" project, my final endeavor for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at the University of Haifa. This project showcases my grasp of OOP principles through a vehicle factory simulation. Create diverse vehicles, customize attributes, and simulate operations. Your exploration of this project will provide insight into my journey through the world of OOP. Feel free to explore, contribute, and learn along with me!
